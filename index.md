# Seq-N-Slide: sequencing data analysis pipeline

Seq-N-Slide is a set of automated workflows for common sequencing-based (Illumina) protocols, such as RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, WGBS/RRBS methylation, whole genome/exome/targeted variant detection, and contaminant screening.
It was written with novice users in mind and optimized for simplicity of use.
It is designed to work on the NYULH HPC UltraViolet (formerly BigPurple) cluster.

Check the [usage instructions](usage) for more details.

If you are a new user, try the [RNA-seq demo](tutorials/rna-seq) to familiarize yourself with the workflow.

Any questions or issues can be posted on [GitHub](https://github.com/igordot/sns/issues).
